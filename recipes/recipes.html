    <h1>Rock Cinnamon Toast</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This french toast is THE BEST EVER. I can say they’re honestly the best I’ve ever had, and I love french toast. The best part of this recipe is 100% the peanut butter sauce. It’s really the decisive component. If you love peanut butter, Rock toast is definitely for you. If you prefer, you can also use another nut butter. Another component that I really appreciated was the toasted coconut. I’ve seen a few versions include Tequila-infused flakes but the original one didn’t include this. If you want to walk the extra mile, soak the flakes for a couple of hours in Tequila before toasting them in the oven.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>French Toast</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>250 ml milk</li>
        <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>75 g brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>    
        <li>¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 2in/6cm thick slices of brioche bread you can also make 4 thinner slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Peanut Butter Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tbsp peanut butter</li>
        <li>150 g maple syrup or other syrup / honey you like</li>
        <li>6 tbsp coconut cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Whipped Cream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 ml whipping cream cold, straight from the fridge</li>
        <li>2 tbsp icing sugar</li>
        <li>½ vanilla pod, only the seeds or 1 tbsp vanilla paste, or 1 tsp vanilla extract or essence</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Cooking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To Serve</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Toasted coconut flakes I like to toast them in a preheated oven at 180°C/350°F for 10-15min</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>French Toast</h3>
    <ol>
        
        <li>In a bowl, combine all the ingredients except the bread with a whisk. You can also use a blender.</li>

        <li>Soak the slices of bread for 2 hours on each side. You can also soak them overnight in the fridge and in the morning you turn them for 30min-1hr to get the other side as well. Here I recommend that at home it's easier to use thinner slices of bread so the soaking is just for a minute.</li>
